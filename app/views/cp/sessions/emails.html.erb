<%= box_wrapper "Login Email list", :no_tabs => true do %>
	Hi! We changed the way you login. Instead of a username, you'll now just use your e-mail. Your password is the same as it was before.<br />
	If you've forgotten what your e-mail was at the BIRN, find your name on the folllowing list:<br /><br />
	
	<% @users.each do |u| %>
		<%= u.name %> - <%= u.email %><br />
	<% end %>
<% end %>
